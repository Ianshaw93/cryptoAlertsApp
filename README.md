# cryptoAlertsApp
Crypto Currency Price Alerts App with the GUI created using Kivy and information gathered using the Coingecko API.

This app is still in development.

Users will be able to view current prices and market charts for cryptocurrencies and add alerts for when price is higher/lower than user defined price.  A notification is sent to the user on their device when target criteria is met.

# App so Far
From the main screen users will be able to navigate to any of the crytocurrency pages.  A video demo of the Bitcoin page is shown in the link directly below:

Screen grab of Bitcoin page with 60000 entered by user for test.

For the test the user selects the less than button and the screen grab below shows the corresponding alert notification that the market price is less than the target price.

# Future Features
The page corresponding to each coin will show price charts for 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days; the alerts created by the user will be shown below the more than/less than buttons in a scrollable part of the screen; further coin pages will be added that can be accessed from the main menu; the main menu will show the 24 hr chart,current price for each coin and whether the user has any alarms configured for that particular coin.
