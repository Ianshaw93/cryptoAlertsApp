# cryptoAlertsApp
Crypto Currency Price Alerts App with the GUI created using Kivy and information gathered using the Coingecko API.

This app is still in development.

Users will be able to view current prices and market charts for cryptocurrencies and add alerts for when price is higher/lower than user defined price.  A notification is sent to the user on their device when target criteria is met.

See Bitcoin page below.  The page corresponding to each coin will show price charts for 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days; the alarms box shown is a placeholder and will allow users to enter the objective price and whether the alert will function when the price is higher or lower than this price.
